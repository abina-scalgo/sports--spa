    <B>Football</B> also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal.
    Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.

Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. 
Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.

It is called field hockey to distinguish it from the similar game played on ice.

                Hockey is believed to date from the earliest civilizations. The Arabs, Greeks, Persians, and Romans each had their own versions, and traces of a stick game played by the Aztec Indians of South America have been found. Hockey can also be identified with other early games, such as hurling and shinty. During the Middle Ages a French stick game called hoquet was played, and the English word may be derived from it.
        
                Hockey began to be played in English schools in the late 19th century, and the first men’s hockey club, at Blackheath in southeastern London, recorded a minute book in 1861. Teddington, another London club, introduced several major variations, including the ban of using hands or lifting sticks above the shoulder, the replacement of the rubber cube by a sphere as the ball, and most importantly, the adopting of a striking circle, which was incorporated into the rules of the newly founded Hockey Association in London in 1886.</p>

                    surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. 
                    Either individually or in teams of two,  players take alternating turns returning a light, 
                    hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small  rackets until they 
                    fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and 
                    constant attention,  and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports,
                    which can heavily affect the ball's  trajectory. 
                    Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, 
                    table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels  and ages.
                    Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's  and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                    Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), 
                    founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF  handbook. 
                    ITTF  currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.

        <td><p style="margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;"><strong>Badminton </strong>is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

            Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.

            The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

            The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles;[2] mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

            <p style="margin-right: 10%; text-align: justify;">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p></td>

              <td><p style="margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;"> is a 15-a-side team sport. The object of the game is to ground 
                the ball behind the opponent's try line, into what is called the in-goal 
                area. Rugby is played both with the ball in hand and by kicking the ball. 
                However, when the ball is being carried in hand it can only be thrown or 
                handed off backwards.
                This is because it is the progress of the player and not the ball that is decisive in this sport. That is one difference between rugby
                 and American football, although the two are often confused among
                  laypeople.
                <br>
                It is a sport anyone who has a pair of football boots, sports gear a
                nd a mouth guard can play. But before getting started, these players at the Frankfurt Rugby Club practice a bit of technique, as coordination and 
                ball control are essential in this sport. Rugby is a full-contact sport. You have to learn to bring down your opponent. This takes toughness. Strength, 
                craftiness and body control are of the essence.
    
    This is what is called a scrum. After many rule infringements play is often 
    restarted with a scrum. The forwards on each team crouch and bind together. 
    They then shove and push each other to get to the ball, which is thrown into 
    the scrum from the side.
    
    The ball is thrown in and the forwards lift one of their teammates above the
     scrum, he, in turn, tries to catch the ball and pass it to a teammate. This 
     is called a line-out and is done when the ball has gone into touch. During the
      scrimmage at the end of practice there is no tackling, that is no body contact.
       This is to keep these novices from getting injured. Here, this player finds the right spot, 
       catches the ball and grounds the ball in the in-goal area. Even beginners can score points. Getting 
       into rugby is easy. Anyone can play, and the younger you start the better. Starting as 
    a child is ideal as rugby is the perfect sport for getting super fit.

Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries.Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
