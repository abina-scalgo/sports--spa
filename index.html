          <td><p> is a 15-a-side team sport. The object of the game is to ground 
            the ball behind the opponent's try line, into what is called the in-goal 
            area. Rugby is played both with the ball in hand and by kicking the ball. 
            However, when the ball is being carried in hand it can only be thrown or 
            handed off backwards.
            This is because it is the progress of the player and not the ball that is decisive in this sport. That is one difference between rugby
             and American football, although the two are often confused among
              laypeople.
            <br>
            It is a sport anyone who has a pair of football boots, sports gear a
            nd a mouth guard can play. But before getting started, these players at the Frankfurt Rugby Club practice a bit of technique, as coordination and 
            ball control are essential in this sport. Rugby is a full-contact sport. You have to learn to bring down your opponent. This takes toughness. Strength, 
            craftiness and body control are of the essence.

This is what is called a scrum. After many rule infringements play is often 
restarted with a scrum. The forwards on each team crouch and bind together. 
They then shove and push each other to get to the ball, which is thrown into 
the scrum from the side.

The ball is thrown in and the forwards lift one of their teammates above the
 scrum, he, in turn, tries to catch the ball and pass it to a teammate. This 
 is called a line-out and is done when the ball has gone into touch. During the
  scrimmage at the end of practice there is no tackling, that is no body contact.
   This is to keep these novices from getting injured. Here, this player finds the right spot, 
   catches the ball and grounds the ball in the in-goal area. Even beginners can score points. Getting 
   into rugby is easy. Anyone can play, and the younger you start the better. Starting as 
a child is ideal as rugby is the perfect sport for getting super fit.

            <td><p style="margin-right: 10%; text-align: justify;" >Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, 
                    is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing 
                    surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. 
                    Either individually or in teams of two,  players take alternating turns returning a light, 
                    hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small  rackets until they 
                    fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and 
                    constant attention,  and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports,
                    which can heavily affect the ball's  trajectory. 
                    Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, 
                    table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels  and ages.
                    Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's  and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                    Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), 
                    founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF  handbook. 
                    ITTF  currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.
