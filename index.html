                    <p><strong>Kabaddi</strong> is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries.<mark>Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. </mark>It is the national sport of Bangladesh.It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
