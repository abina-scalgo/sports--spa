                    <p><strong>Kabaddi</strong> is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries.<mark>Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. </mark>It is the national sport of Bangladesh.It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

                    is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing 
                    surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. 
                    Either individually or in teams of two,  players take alternating turns returning a light, 
                    hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small  rackets until they 
                    fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and 
                    constant attention,  and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports,
                    which can heavily affect the ball's  trajectory. 
                    Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, 
                    table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels  and ages.
                    Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's  and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                    Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), 
                    founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF  handbook. 
                    ITTF  currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.
