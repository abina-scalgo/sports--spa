            <td><div style="text-align:justify"><strong>Badminton </strong>is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

                Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
                
                The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
                
                The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles;[2] mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

                    is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing 
                    surface being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. 
                    Either individually or in teams of two,  players take alternating turns returning a light, 
                    hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small  rackets until they 
                    fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and 
                    constant attention,  and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports,
                    which can heavily affect the ball's  trajectory. 
                    Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, and relative accessibility of equipment, 
                    table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels  and ages.
                    Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[3] with event categories in both men's  and women's singles, and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
                    Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), 
                    founded in 1926, and specifies the official rules in the ITTF  handbook. 
                    ITTF  currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.
